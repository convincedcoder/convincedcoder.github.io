This can feel quite restrictive, but it can actually help teams increase the quality of their code base and their ease of deployment. This post aims to give a high-level overview of what practicing Trunk Based Development looks like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-trunk-based-development&quot;&gt;What is Trunk Based Development?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Collaboration between developers happens through regular commits to a single branch, the “trunk” (ideally, several commits per developer per day)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Developers strive to keep the code in the trunk working at all times (builds, passes tests, etc.). Every commit on the trunk should be releasable without much additional effort.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Developers either commit directly to the trunk or commit to short-lived feature branches that are merged into the trunk after successful review&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If used, feature branches don’t last more than a few days max and only a single developer (or pair of developers) commits to a single feature branch&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Releasing happens either directly from the trunk (tagging a commit) or from release branches branched off of the trunk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;trunk-based-development-advantages&quot;&gt;Trunk Based Development advantages&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reducing-distance-between-developers&quot;&gt;Reducing distance between developers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the biggest advantage of trunk-based development is that it limits distances between developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a branching model with long-lived feature branches, one or more developers can work in separation from the rest of the team for days, weeks, or even months. Being able to work in isolation from the rest of the team can seem like a blessing. However, someday, your code will have to be integrated with the rest of the codebase. The more pain you avoided (or should I say postponed) by choosing not to adjust to changes others were making, the more pain you are saving up until the time has come to merge your feature branch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people have argued that, as version control systems get better and better at merging code, we really shouldn’t be afraid of big merges anymore. What they seem to be overlooking is the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There will alway be cases where source control systems cannot perform the merge automatically. These merge conflicts need to resolve manually, and this becomes more and more difficult as the scope of the merge increases.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Even worse than this are the conflicts that your source control system does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; pick up on. These conflicts are called &lt;a href=&quot;https://martinfowler.com/bliki/SemanticConflict.html&quot;&gt;semantic conflicts&lt;/a&gt;. The merge seems successful, but the code will either fail to compile, fail to run or (most dangerously) succeed to run but produce incorrect results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some examples of semantic conflicts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I rename a method, letting my IDE help me to change its name everywhere it is used. Meanwhile, you create some new code that calls the method (by its old name). Note that this will trigger compiler errors once we merge our code (if using a statically typed language), unless there is now another method with the old name and same signature that does something else than the renamed method (more dangerous).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is a method that has a certain side effect. I decide to split out the side effect into a separate method, potentially because I have a new case where it is not needed. Then, I make sure to update all existing calls to the method to call the method for the side effect separately. Meanwhile, you write some new code calling the original method and expecting the side effect. The compiler doesn’t detect anything once we merge our code, we can only hope our tests will.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I change an abstraction while you build some code on top of the original abstraction. This one will probably trigger some compiler errors once we merge (if our language is statically typed), but could require you to completely change your approach.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If developers collaborate on a single branch, these types of issues are less likely to occur because developers try to stay up to date with the trunk and analyze if any changes made by other developers affect them. And, if semantic conflicts do occur, Trunk Based Development will make sure they are detected sooner rather than later, making them much easier to solve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;commitment-to-quality-of-code-and-build-process&quot;&gt;Commitment to quality of code and build process&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that the team strives to keep the code in the trunk working at all times automatically means a dedication to the quality of code and the build process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There will likely be more communication regarding changes, especially if they are likely to affect other developers. Developers can also chop up changes into several commits with the sole purpose of making it more clear what they are changing and helping other developers consume and adjust to these changes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dedication to working code in the trunk means that there is a high bar for code changes and typically also some kind of reviewing process. Developers are typically also more careful with their changes if they know they immediately affect the entire team.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Keeping the code in the trunk working also means there is a strong incentive to set up a good build process that performs as many automated checks as possible to make sure the code actually does work. Developers should also run this build process locally in order to make sure their changes work &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; actually pushing their code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This part also highlights a possible challenge: Trunk Based Development does require a certain level of dedication to quality from everyone in the team and the team needs to be able to self-police if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;flexibility-regarding-releases&quot;&gt;Flexibility regarding releases&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In principle, every commit on the trunk should be a working version of the software, very close to being releasable. This means that Trunk Based Development provides a lot of flexibility regarding when and what to release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;commits-and-reviewing&quot;&gt;Commits and reviewing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;committing-straight-to-the-trunk&quot;&gt;Committing straight to the trunk&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Especially for smaller teams, committing straight to the trunk can work. Typically, there will be some kind of review (on top of the automated build process that developers can run on their machines as well). If the team uses pair programming, a pair is often allowed to commit directly to the trunk because two pairs of eyes looked at the code. Synchronous review, where the committer calls a colleague over to check the code before actually committing, is also a possibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;short-lived-feature-branches-for-review&quot;&gt;Short-lived feature branches for review&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trunk Based Development allow feature branches as a tool for code review, with some restrictions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Feature branches are short-lived (shorter is better, definitely not more than a few days)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Only one developer commits to a given feature branch.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Merging from the feature branch to trunk is also allowed once and also means the end of the feature branch&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Merging from trunk to bring the feature branch up to date with new changes is allowed anytime. It is especially recommended to bring your feature branch fully up to date with the trunk (and check that it builds) before actually merging into trunk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019-02-16-Trunk-based-development/feature-branch.png&quot; alt=&quot;Feature branch&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pull requests (as offered by GitHub and Bitbucket) are a good way to handle this, and they make it easy to delete the branch when you merge it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;review-after-the-fact&quot;&gt;Review after the fact&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it is the team’s responsibility to keep the code in the trunk working, team members may choose to review commits that were pushed to the trunk. In case of any issues, the team can quickly coordinate on how to fix them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;trunk-based-development-and-continuous-integration&quot;&gt;Trunk Based Development and Continuous Integration&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on who you ask, Continuous Integration can mean two things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Developers very regularly integrate their changes into a single place where changes from all developers come together, making sure that they are of sufficient quality before doing so. You could argue this was the initially intended meaning of Continuous Integration, and it is more or less the same as the main premise of Trunk Based Development.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is some kind of process that watches the source control repository for changes and runs new commits through the build process (including tests etc.), alerting the team if the build does not pass.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second meaning is something very useful to have if practicing Trunk Based Development. If it somehow occurs that the code in the trunk does not build, the team can take action immediately. Note that this should in principle never happen, as developers should run the same build process locally before pushing their code. This kind of automated build is also useful to have on feature branches and can be one of the deciding factors in the decision to merge. For checking commits on feature branches, it is important that the branches are sufficiently up to date with the trunk. This is especially the case right before merging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;trunk-based-development-and-continuous-delivery&quot;&gt;Trunk Based Development and Continuous Delivery&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once a team has set up Continuous Integration (in every sense of the word), it can choose to move on to the next step: &lt;em&gt;Continuous Delivery&lt;/em&gt;. This means that commits that build successfully are automatically deployed to a quality assurance or acceptance testing environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Continuous Deployment&lt;/em&gt; takes it a step further: here, commits that build successfully are actually pushed all the way to production. Not that this requires very extensive checking as part of the build process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;releases&quot;&gt;Releases&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;branching-for-release&quot;&gt;Branching for release&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of branching for release is relatively simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The decision is made to release a state of the trunk&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A release branch is created, starting from the commit representing that state of the trunk&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Potentially, some very limited work happens in the release branch in order to fully make it release-ready&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The code is released and the released commit is tagged&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the release contains bugs, the process is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fix the bugs on the trunk and cherry-pick them into the release branch, and not the other way around! This helps prevent regression bugs caused by applying a fix in a release branch but forgetting to apply the fix on the trunk as well. Exceptions are only allowed if it is really not possible to reproduce the bug on the trunk.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The code is released and the released commit is tagged&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019-02-16-Trunk-based-development/branch-for-release.png&quot; alt=&quot;Branch for release&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;releasing-straight-from-trunk&quot;&gt;Releasing straight from trunk&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some teams release straight from the trunk, without creating a new release branch. This is doable if commits on the trunk are really release-ready. In this case, there are often een no real version numbers. Instead, commit identifiers can be used. This approach is often seen in teams that release very often. In case of bugs in a release, these teams typically choose a fix-forward strategy where they fix the bug as soon as possible and then push a new release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;creating-a-release-branch-only-when-needed&quot;&gt;Creating a release branch only when needed&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teams following this approach release directly from trunk, tagging the commit with a release number. If a bug exists in the release, a release branch is retroactively created from that commit (modern source control systems allow this) and fixes can be cherry-picked into that branch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what this looks like when releasing version 1.1 directly from the trunk:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019-02-16-Trunk-based-development/release-from-trunk.png&quot; alt=&quot;Release from trunk&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, if a fix is needed for the release, a branch is created retroactively from the release commit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2019-02-16-Trunk-based-development/release-from-trunk-then-branch.png&quot; alt=&quot;Release from trunk, then branch&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dealing-with-larger-changes&quot;&gt;Dealing with larger changes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In principle, every commit in the trunk should be releasable. When introducing new features or performing other large changes, it is often not feasible to make all of the changes in a single commit of reasonable size (and smaller commits are seen as better). Fortunately, there are some strategies that can be used to spread out changes while keeping each commit potentially releasable. There will be some follow-up posts where these are discussed in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;feature-flags&quot;&gt;Feature flags&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feature flags (also known as feature toggles) are a mechanism to alter system behavior without changing code. They can be thought of as light switches that switch on or switch off some parts of the system. As long as a new feature that is being built is not release ready yet, the feature can be hidden behind a feature flag in a configuration file or command line parameter. Inside the code, there is then some logic that looks at the flag and decides which behavior to enable. This makes it possible to ship the product containing the code for the new feature without the new feature actually being enabled in production. Meanwhile, the development team can enable the feature for testing purposes by switching on the feature flag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also possible to use feature flags to make an application behave differently for different users, which can be helpful for A/B-testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that feature flags do introduce some complexity in the codebase. It can also be challenging to ensure that all relevant flag combinations have been tested properly. If possible, prevent the need for feature flags by designing features in such a way that even the earliest work on a feature either already has some value or simply does not change the experience of the user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;branch-by-abstraction&quot;&gt;Branch by Abstraction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Branch by Abstraction is useful if the team needs to replace a certain component of the system, but this needs to be spread out over multiple commits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, this is how it works:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Write a layer of indirection on top of the component you need to replace&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make clients call the indirection instead of the original component&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Now, use the layer of indirection to switch over to the new component as it is being built. The new layer of indirection could already forward some calls to the new component, or there could be a toggle indicating which component implementation to use.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once the new component is fully built and the layer of indirection doesn’t call the old component anymore, get rid of the old component&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If it makes sense, get rid of the layer of indirection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;application-strangulation&quot;&gt;Application strangulation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Application strangulation is very similar to Branch by Abstraction, but it works at the level of different applications or processes. An example is the migration of an API to a completely different programming language. You could then put a reverse proxy in front of the old API and have it start forwarding some calls to the new API as that one is being built. Once the new API is fully operational and all calls are routed to it, you can then get rid of the old API and potentially also the reverse proxy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-good-practices-when-applying-trunk-based-development&quot;&gt;Some good practices when applying Trunk Based Development&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Quick reviews: Developers try to get their code reviewed as soon as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Chasing HEAD: Developers try to stay up to date with changes to the trunk.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shared nothing: Developers run the build locally before pushing their code, typically including integration and functional tests talking to real databases etc. This means individual developers must be able to run the application and all its dependencies locally, without depending on resources shared with others.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Facilitating commits: Developers sometimes chop up their work into multiple smaller commits in order to make their changes easier for their teammates to adjust to. For example, when building a feature entails introducing a new dependency, this dependency could be introduced separately through a new commit that the developer explicitly notifies the team of.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Thin Vertical Slices: Stories or tasks from the backlog can ideally be implemented completely by a single developer or pair of developers in a short amount of time and small number of commits. They cut across the whole stack and they do not need to be passed around between developers with specialized knowledge in order to get completed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Therefore, the quality of your code as a team can greatly improve if developers collaborate on writing code. This post talks about some ways to handle code review and collaboration when writing code in a team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;instant-review-pair-programming&quot;&gt;Instant review (pair programming)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first type of review, instant review, means that all code is instantly reviewed as it is being written. This is what happens when doing pair programming. One programmer, the driver, writes the actual code. The other programmer, the navigator, reviews the code immediately. While the driver and navigator will be switching roles pretty often, the fact remains that there will always be someone writing the code and someone instantly reviewing it. Often, for teams that require code to be reviewed, a pairing partner counts as reviewer. This means that, if only one reviewer’s approval is needed, a pair can commit code without further review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;advantages-of-pair-programming&quot;&gt;Advantages of pair programming&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pairing is a good way to create joint ownership of the code, preventing the very dangerous situation where there are parts of the codebase that only one developer is willing, allowed or able to maintain. Because all code was written jointly by at least two people, you have at least two people who know the idea behind the code and the details about how it works. By mixing up the pairs frequently, this knowledge gets spread across the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another advantage of pair programming is that it helps with focus. While there is a lot of interaction within a pair, this interaction does not require context switching because both members of the pair are already working on the same thing. The pair can also keep each other on track and prevent each other from slacking off or being tempted to write quick-and-dirty code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that there is a driver and navigator also means that you have different levels of overview. When you are writing code alone, it is sometimes hard to keep an overview of what you are doing when you are deep into some specific part of the code. In pair programming, there is always someone (the navigator) who can help the driver keep track of the bigger picture. The roles also switch frequently, which means that both members of the pair have experienced the process of writing the code from different levels of overview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Classical pair programming (with a driver and a navigator) works well when you need to write some code solving a complex business problem with lots of possible scenarios. While the driver codes, the navigator can provide guidance and help with making sure that all scenarios and edge cases are taken into account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pair-programming-and-junior-developers&quot;&gt;Pair programming and junior developers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advantages mentioned above apply especially to pairs consisting of relatively experienced people with a similar level of experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pairing a senior with a junior can work, but changes the dynamic of the pair to be more focused on mentoring. Typically, the junior developer will be the driver most of the time and the senior will help the junior keep track of the different cases to handle and provide instant help when the junior is stuck. This can be a very good way to get the junior developer up to speed quickly. In order for the junior to learn, the senior developer should try not to give too much guidance or tell the junior exactly how to tackle the problem. Instead, the senior can give some hints or ask some questions to the junior, allowing the junior to figure out what to do. Sometimes, it can even make sense to let the junior wander down a path that the senior knows to be a dead end. The basic idea is that the junior should be allowed to make mistakes, while the senior can then help the junior to learn from those mistakes by really understanding what went wrong and why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a senior developer, mentoring a junior in this way can be exhausting and sometimes frustrating. However, pairing with a junior also provides benefits for the senior. Junior developers typically spend a lot of time learning, and in doing so they might have picked up on something that benefits the senior as well. Additionally, the questions asked by the junior developer force the senior to be explicit about the reasoning behind certain best practices, the way the codebase was designed, the approaches used for certain problems, … Sometimes, being forced to be explain things that are obvious to you can be a learning experience in itself, and it can help expose some potential gaps in your knowledge or even flaws in the design that went unnoticed. Despite these benefits, junior-senior pairing is likely still exhausting to the senior, so it probably helps to switch things up after a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pairing two junior developers is more risky. While there is a chance that they can fill in the gaps in each other’s knowledge and reasoning, there is also a big chance that you will just have two people being stuck for hours on a problem that could have been solved quickly with a bit of guidance from a senior developer. Forbidding less experienced developers to pair with each other is a bit harsh, but it should be the responsibility of the team to make sure that pairs of less experienced devs receive sufficient guidance. The team should help them estimate how much time they should allow themselves to spend on a task and how quickly they should ask for help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mobbing&quot;&gt;Mobbing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mobbing is similar to pair programming, but involves more people. Some types of mobbing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Code jam: This is basically pairing, but with more navigators. The driver still switches frequently. Often, code jams are time-boxed sessions dedicated to solving a specifically hairy challenge.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Randori: Here, you have one regular pair (driver + navigator, switching roles often). The rest of the people just observe. However, every so often, one of the observers replaces one member of the pair.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mob programming: This is similar to a code jam. However, instead of having time-boxed sessions, the team sees this type of collaboration as their main way of working. Teams using this approach say it helps with learning, quick decision making, communication, preventing technical debt, etc. If you want to know more about this, you could have a look at this video:  &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/131643015&quot;&gt;Mob Programming, A Whole Team Approach - Woody Zuill&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;when-not-to-use-pair-programming&quot;&gt;When not to use pair programming&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While pair programming has a lot of benefits, it can be intense and exhausting if done all the time. Additionally, there are situations where it would be way more productive to have people do (some of) their work separately instead of looking at the same screen together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One example where pair programming doesn’t really make sense is solving a technical problem requiring lots of research, exploration and experimentation. Googling stuff, playing around and building small experiments or quick proof of concepts works way better if developers work on their own machine. Of course, this doesn’t mean that they can’t check in regularly to discuss their findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;synchronous-review&quot;&gt;Synchronous review&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Synchronous review is an approach were you first create something (code, design, …) on your own and then call someone over in order to get feedback. It’s called synchronous because it requires both you and your reviewer to be looking at your work at the same time. We will later compare this to asynchronous review, where that is not the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;advantages-of-synchronous-review&quot;&gt;Advantages of synchronous review&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Synchronous review is helpful if the reviewer is not very familiar with the problem you are solving, because direct communication is a convenient way of explaining the context of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Direct communication is also very helpful if there is the need to have a real discussion about the code instead of just receiving a few remarks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another benefit of synchronous review, when compared to pair programming, is that you still get the chance to work on something separately, explore and make your own mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;synchronous-review-and-pairing&quot;&gt;Synchronous review and pairing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Synchronous review is clearly different from classical pair programming where a driver and navigator sit together to write the code. However, even when working in pairs, synchronous review can be helpful for situations where classical pair programming doesn’t make sense or when you and your pairing partner need a break from the constant interaction for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way of using synchronous review with your pairing partner is the “divide and conquer” strategy. Instead of solving a problem together as a driver and navigator, you divide the problem into some smaller tasks and divide them amongst the two of you. Each person works separately on their tasks, but you are there to support each other where needed and you frequently sit together to review what you have done and attempt to improve each other’s work. This approach can be a good idea when doing some research and experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An alternative is “supported soloing”. This is similar so “divide and conquer”, except for the fact that you are now working on completely separate things. However, you are still regularly providing each other with support and feedback. This can work well for seniors working together, a senior supporting a junior or even a small number of seniors supporting a pool of juniors. In this case, it’s very important to actually be available for providing feedback and support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, even when doing classical pair programming, synchronous review can be used if the pair needs some support from the rest of the team to solve a particularly hairy problem or make an important decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;drawbacks-of-synchronous-review&quot;&gt;Drawbacks of synchronous review&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Synchronous review means that both you and your reviewer need to be looking at the work at the same time. While this is sometimes very valuable, it has the drawback of requiring context switches. At the point in time when you would like some feedback, your teammate may fully focused on another problem. This means that you either need to break your colleague’s focus, or wait until the colleague is free (and at that moment, you may actually be fully focused on something). Context switches and interruptions can have a huge effect on productivity, especially for tasks that require deep focus and concentration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another drawback of synchronous review is that it does not allow the reviewer to have a look at the code or the problem before actually coming over to review. Without being able to take some time to have good look at the code and let it sink in, the reviewer may fail to spot some potential problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;asynchronous-review&quot;&gt;Asynchronous review&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asynchronous review is very similar to synchronous review, in the sense that you still first create something (code, design, …) on your own and then ask for feedback. The big difference is that asynchronous review does not require you and the reviewer to be looking at the code at the same moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asynchronous review processes typically use some sort of technology that allows you to make your work available for people to review and allows reviewers to provide feedback. A very popular form of this are the pull requests provided by tools as GitHub and Bitbucket. You can push a branch and attach a description of what the goal of your change is, why you made certain decisions, and so on. You and your reviewers can then discuss (parts of) your code through the tool. The pull request also tracks additional changes you make in response to feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;advantages-of-asynchronous-review&quot;&gt;Advantages of asynchronous review&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A big advantage of asynchronous review is the fact that it is asynchronous. You can finish and push your code when it is convenient for you, while your reviewer can look at it when it’s convenient for them. This also allows the reviewer to have a proper look at the code, taking as much time as needed to really understand what the code does, how it handles certain situations and how it could affect the rest of the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another advantage is that asynchronous review makes it easier to check the readability of the code. With nobody being there to talk the reviewer through the code, they will immediately experience how easy it is to understand what the code is actually doing without additional explanation. And, if the person who wrote the code has actually provided some documentation and explanation when submitting their code, this means there is actually some written documentation which can help future maintainers of the code as well. In fact, most processes involving pull requests are set up in such a way that you can easily find the relevant pull request (including additional documentation) that introduced a certain piece of code into the codebase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;asynchronous-review-and-pairing&quot;&gt;Asynchronous review and pairing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When applying the pairing strategies described in the section on synchronous review, asynchronous review could be used instead of synchronous review if there is a need or desire to handle things in an asynchronous fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;drawbacks-of-asynchronous-review&quot;&gt;Drawbacks of asynchronous review&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an asynchronous reviewing process, you may have to wait a while for feedback from you reviewer(s). This means that you will likely need to start working on something different and later switch back to the code that was awaiting review. This is a form of context switching, although you can wait to process the feedback until a time that is convenient for you. For the reviewer, the situation is similar: there is still some context switching going on, but at least they are not interrupted during moments of deep focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deciding what to do while waiting for feedback can sometimes be challenging. The simplest option is often to work on something unrelated to your code change, like other issues, documentation, learning, … However, if you are keeping commits and issues small (which is typically a good thing), you may run into the situation where the only thing that makes sense to work on is something that depends directly on the code awaiting feedback. This means that, if you later need to make significant changes to your earlier code because of the feedback you received, your new code may need significant changes as well. In this case, it’s probably not a good idea to submit your new code as long as the initial code has not been properly reviewed and approved yet. If you come to the point where you would like to submit your new changes but you have still not received proper feedback on the changes they depend on, it may be right time to start asking your colleagues for a synchronous review of the original changes and potentially the new code as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, the team should make sure that code and comments are reviewed and processed fairly quickly, meaning that the feedback loop stays relatively short. Otherwise, asynchronous review will negatively affect the productivity of the team. The longer the feedback loop gets, the harder it is for a committer or reviewer to switch contexts when they receive feedback on their code or comments. A longer feedback loop  also increases the chance that other changes in the codebase will conflict with the code under review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When doing asynchronous review, you should specifically look out for excessive back-and-forth discussion. If it is taking a long time and a lot of discussion to review a piece of code, it is probably a better idea to look at the code together (synchronous review) and possibly even do some pair programming. Some companies also have guidelines asking you to just accept the changes if the code is reasonable and to offer your ideas for improvement as suggestions for new changes rather than reasons for rejecting the current changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;review-after-the-fact&quot;&gt;Review after the fact&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Review after the fact means that code is reviewed after it is committed or pulled into the main branch. One example is a mob review where the entire team sits together to have a look at a piece of code in order to share knowledge and possibly get suggestions for further improvement. It is also an option that developers are notified when commits are made to the main branch and can then have a look at the code and potentially suggest some improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is often not ideal to have this as the only kind of review, it could be useful to combine this with some other way of reviewing. For example, you could set up a process where code can be pushed directly to the main branch by a pair, but other developers can check the changes afterwards and suggest additional improvements or request a knowledge sharing session. Review after the fact can also make sense if the current availability of qualified reviewers would not allow for timely review of changes. In that case, it is probably a good idea to explicitly make the team aware that the code has not been reviewed yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;automated-review&quot;&gt;Automated review&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is a bit different, in the sense that there are no humans involved here. Automated review is a great addition to any reviewing process. Some examples are automated code formatting, a linter enforcing a certain coding style and forbidding some bad practices, a script that automatically checks dependencies for security vulnerabilities and licensing issues, … The more checks you can perform automatically, the more time and energy developers can spend thinking about the actual behavior of the code.&lt;/p&gt;

This post will give you some idea of how this can be done and why it can be useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-typescript-compiler-api&quot;&gt;The TypeScript compiler API&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When writing an application using TypeScript, you typically use the “typescript” module as a build tool to transpile your TypeScript code into JavaScript. This is usually all you need. However, if you import the “typescript” module in your application code, you get access to the compiler API. This compiler API provides some very powerful tools for interacting with TypeScript code. Some of its features are documented on the TypeScript wiki: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Using-the-Compiler-API&quot;&gt;Using the Compiler API&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sourcefiles-and-the-abstract-syntax-tree-ast&quot;&gt;SourceFiles and the abstract syntax tree (AST)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A SourceFile is perhaps the most basic form of processed TypeScript code. A TypeScript SourceFile contains a representation of the source code itself, from which you can extract the &lt;em&gt;abstract syntax tree (AST)&lt;/em&gt; for the code. An AST represents the syntactical structure of the program as a tree, starting from the SourceFile itself and drilling down into the statements and their building blocks. In general, compilers or interpreters typically construct an AST as an initial step in the processing of the source code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example, consider the following simple TypeScript code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s write some code that creates a SourceFile for this code and prints the AST.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;typescript&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;test.ts&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;code&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;`const test: number = 1 + 2;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sourceFile&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;createSourceFile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ScriptTarget&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Latest&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;printRecursiveFrom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;node&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Node&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;indentLevel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sourceFile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;SourceFile&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;indentation&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;-&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;repeat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;indentLevel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;syntaxKind&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;SyntaxKind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;node&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;kind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;nodeText&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;node&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getText&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sourceFile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;indentation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;syntaxKind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;nodeText&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;node&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;forEachChild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;child&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;printRecursiveFrom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;child&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;indentLevel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sourceFile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;printRecursiveFrom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sourceFile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sourceFile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This prints the following AST:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;SourceFile: const test: number = 1 + 2;
-VariableStatement: const test: number = 1 + 2;
--VariableDeclarationList: const test: number = 1 + 2
---VariableDeclaration: test: number = 1 + 2
----Identifier: test
----NumberKeyword: number
----BinaryExpression: 1 + 2
-----FirstLiteralToken: 1
-----PlusToken: +
-----FirstLiteralToken: 2
-EndOfFileToken:
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, we used &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ts.Node.forEachChild()&lt;/code&gt; to get the children for a node in the AST. There is an alternative to this, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ts.Node.getChildren(sourceFile).forEach()&lt;/code&gt;, which creates a more detailed AST:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;SourceFile: const test: number = 1 + 2;
-SyntaxList: const test: number = 1 + 2;
--VariableStatement: const test: number = 1 + 2;
---VariableDeclarationList: const test: number = 1 + 2
----ConstKeyword: const
----SyntaxList: test: number = 1 + 2
-----VariableDeclaration: test: number = 1 + 2
------Identifier: test
------ColonToken: :
------NumberKeyword: number
------FirstAssignment: =
------BinaryExpression: 1 + 2
-------FirstLiteralToken: 1
-------PlusToken: +
-------FirstLiteralToken: 2
---SemicolonToken: ;
-EndOfFileToken:
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at generated ASTs is an interesting way to learn more about the TypeScript language and how the compiler represents source code internally. If you want to look at ASTs in a more interactive way and view more information for the nodes in the tree, I recommend using &lt;a href=&quot;https://ts-ast-viewer.com/&quot;&gt;TypeScript AST Viewer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;turning-code-into-a-program&quot;&gt;Turning code into a Program&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While SourceFiles are easy to create, the functionality they offer doesn’t always suffice. In order to do more interesting things like getting diagnostics or using the type checker, you need a Program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obtaining a Program from a file on disk is pretty straightforward. As the following example shows, this can be a one-liner in very simple cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;program&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;createProgram&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;src/test.ts&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting a Program from a simple string of TypeScript code is a bit more tricky. In order to accomplish this, we need to specify a custom CompilerHost instance that will be used by the compiler to retrieve and write files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;typescript&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;test.ts&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;code&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;`const test: number = 1 + 2;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sourceFile&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;createSourceFile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ScriptTarget&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Latest&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;defaultCompilerHost&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;createCompilerHost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;customCompilerHost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;CompilerHost&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;getSourceFile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;languageVersion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;`getSourceFile &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sourceFile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;defaultCompilerHost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getSourceFile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;languageVersion&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;writeFile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;getDefaultLibFileName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;lib.d.ts&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;useCaseSensitiveFileNames&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;getCanonicalFileName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;getCurrentDirectory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;getNewLine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;n&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;getDirectories&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[],&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;fileExists&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;readFile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;program&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;createProgram&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;test.ts&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;customCompilerHost&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// getSourceFile test.ts&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// getSourceFile lib.d.ts&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;getSourceFile&lt;/code&gt; method of the CompilerHost is called twice: once for getting the actual code we want to compile and once for getting &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;lib.d.ts&lt;/code&gt;, the default library specifying the JavaScript/TypeScript features that are available to the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;transpiling-code&quot;&gt;Transpiling code&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transpiling code from TypeScript to plain JavaScript using the compiler API is pretty straightforward. In its simplest form, it takes one line of code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;code&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;`const test: number = 1 + 2;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;transpiledCode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;transpileModule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{}).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;outputText&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;transpiledCode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// var test = 1 + 2;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible to pass several options to the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;transpileModule&lt;/code&gt; method, including the compiler options to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also transpile code by invoking the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;emit()&lt;/code&gt; method on a Program. If you do this for a program created in the most simple way from an actual file on disk, this will put a transpiled .js file next to it. As an example, let’s write a piece of TypeScript code that will transpile itself when run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// file test.ts&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;typescript&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;program&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;createProgram&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;src/test.ts&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;program&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;emit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When this code is transpiled and run, it creates the following JavaScript file next to the test.ts file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// file test.js&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;use strict&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;exports&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;__esModule&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;typescript&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;program&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;createProgram&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;src/test.ts&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;program&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;emit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also interesting to note that, if the file you transpile imports other TypeScript files, those will also be transpiled if the compiler can find them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-diagnostics&quot;&gt;Getting diagnostics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a Program, you can use that Program to obtain diagnostics for the code. In order to get the compiler errors or warnings, use the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;getPreEmitDiagnostics()&lt;/code&gt; method. As an example, take a look at the following code which prints its own diagnostics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;typescript&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;test&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// compiler error&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;program&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;createProgram&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;src/test.ts&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;diagnostics&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getPreEmitDiagnostics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;program&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;diagnostic&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;diagnostics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;diagnostic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;messageText&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;file&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;diagnostic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;fileName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;line&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;lineAndChar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;line&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;`(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;line&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;character&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;)`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Type '&quot;test&quot;' is not assignable to type 'number'.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// (src/test.ts:3:5)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-type-information&quot;&gt;Getting type information&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing that a Program allows you to do is to obtain a TypeChecker for extracting type information from nodes in the AST. The following code obtains a TypeChecker for itself and uses the checker to emit the types of all variable declarations in the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;typescript&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;src/test.ts&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;program&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;createProgram&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sourceFile&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;program&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getSourceFile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;typeChecker&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;program&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getTypeChecker&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;recursivelyPrintVariableDeclarations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;node&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Node&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sourceFile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;SourceFile&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;node&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;kind&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;SyntaxKind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;VariableDeclaration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;typeName&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;typeChecker&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;typeToString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;node&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;nodeText&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;node&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;forEachChild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;child&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;recursivelyPrintVariableDeclarations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;child&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sourceFile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;recursivelyPrintVariableDeclarations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sourceFile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sourceFile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// filename = &quot;src/test.ts&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// (&quot;src/test.ts&quot;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// program = ts.createProgram([filename], {})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// (ts.Program)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// sourceFile = program.getSourceFile(filename)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// (ts.SourceFile)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// typeChecker = program.getTypeChecker()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// (ts.TypeChecker)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// nodeText = node.getText(sourceFile)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// (string)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// type = typeChecker.getTypeAtLocation(node)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// (ts.Type)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// typeName = typeChecker.typeToString(type, node)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// (string)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;use-case-creating-a-custom-linter&quot;&gt;Use case: creating a custom linter&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The TypeScript compiler API makes it pretty straightforward to create your own custom linter that generates errors or warnings if it finds certain things in the code. For an example, see this part of the compiler API documentation: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Using-the-Compiler-API#traversing-the-ast-with-a-little-linter&quot;&gt;Traversing the AST with a little linter&lt;/a&gt;. Note that the code uses the kind SyntaxKind of the node (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;node.kind&lt;/code&gt;) to determine the kind of node and then casts the node to its specific type, allowing for convenient access to certain child nodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The example above doesn’t create a Program, because there is no need to create one. If the information in the AST suffices for your linter, it is easier and more efficient to just create a SourceFile directly. More advanced linters may need type checking, which means you will need to generate a Program for the code to be linted in order to obtain a TypeChecker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;use-case-extracting-type-documentation&quot;&gt;Use case: extracting type documentation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The documentation for the compiler API includes an example that uses a TypeChecker to extract and emit type documentation for the code: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Using-the-Compiler-API#using-the-type-checker&quot;&gt;Using the Type Checker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;use-case-altering-or-creating-code-programmatically&quot;&gt;Use case: altering or creating code programmatically&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible that you want to analyze some TypeScript source code and then alter it in some cases. One way to do this is to traverse the AST and generate a list of changes you want to perform on the code (e.g., remove 2 characters starting from position 11 and insert the string “test” instead). Then, take the source code as a string and apply the changes in reverse order (starting from the end of the source code, so your changes don’t affect the positions where the other changes need to happen).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also programmatically create AST nodes and use them to programmatically generate new TypeScript code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;typescript&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;statement&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;createVariableStatement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[],&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;createVariableDeclarationList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;createVariableDeclaration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;createIdentifier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;testVar&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;createKeywordTypeNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;SyntaxKind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;StringKeyword&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;createStringLiteral&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;test&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)],&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;NodeFlags&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Const&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;printer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;createPrinter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;undefined&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;isnt-typescript-enough&quot;&gt;Isn’t TypeScript enough?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might wonder why it’s even needed to add additional type checking if you’re already using TypeScript. Isn’t type checking exactly what TypeScript is about? Well, TypeScript only performs static type checking at compile time. The generated JavaScript, which is what actually runs when you run your code, does not know anything about the types. While this works fine for type checking within your codebase, it doesn’t provide any kind of protection against malformed input.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example is an API that you expose. Even though you can use TypeScript to describe the input structure that your code should expect, TypeScript itself doesn’t provide any way to check that the input that is provided at runtime actually matches that structure. This is by design: the TypeScript team has limited their scope to compile-time checking only. Therefore, if you receive any kind of input from the outside world, it is typically a good idea to perform some additional runtime type checking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example to use throughout this post, let’s say we have a simple API accepting a person with the following structure:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Person&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;firstName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;lastName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;manual-checks-in-custom-code&quot;&gt;Manual checks in custom code&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An obvious approach here would be to manually write code that checks the input for the existence of the required properties and checks their type as well. However, writing such code can be tedious and error-prone. There is also a possibility for the error-checking code to get out of sync with your static types as changes are made to the codebase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;manually-creating-json-schemas&quot;&gt;Manually creating JSON Schemas&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JSON Schemas are a standard way of constraining the format of JSON input that you receive. Several non-TypeScript applications already use this approach to validate received input.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A very simple JSON Schema describing our input could be the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-json highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;$schema&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;required&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;firstName&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;lastName&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;age&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;properties&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;firstName&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;type&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;string&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;lastName&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;type&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;string&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;age&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;type&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;integer&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;minimum&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may have noticed that this JSON Schema is actually stricter than our original TypeScript type, as we are now requiring &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;age&lt;/code&gt; to be an integer with at least a value of zero. This is perfectly fine: as long as our runtime type checking is at least as restrictive as our static type checking, we are sure that the data we receive fits the static type and the static type checking within our codebase is sufficient to prevent further type errors. This does not work if the runtime type checking is less strict than the static checking. For example, if our JSON Schema allows &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;firstName&lt;/code&gt; to be anything, some of our code that depends on it being a string may fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using JSON Schemas definitely has some advantages. There are lots of libraries that you can use to validate input based on the schema. Because the schema itself is JSON, it’s also easy to store or share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A drawback of JSON Schemas is that they can become very verbose and they can be tedious to generate by hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;automatically-generating-json-schemas&quot;&gt;Automatically generating JSON Schemas&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are libraries that automatically generate JSON Schemas for you based on your TypeScript code. One of those libraries is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/YousefED/typescript-json-schema&quot;&gt;typescript-json-schema&lt;/a&gt;. It works either programmatically or from the command line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This library is intended to be run on some existing code containing the types to generate JSON Schemas for. That means that, if you are changing your code, you need to make sure that your JSON Schemas are generated again if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an alternative, there are also tools that automatically infer JSON Schemas from JSON input you provide. Of course, this doesn’t use the type information you have already defined in your TypeScript code and can lead to errors if there is a mismatch between the input JSON you provide to the tool and the actual TypeScript type definitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-transpilation-approach&quot;&gt;A transpilation approach&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using JSON Schemas is not the only way to check types at runtime. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fabiandev/ts-runtime&quot;&gt;ts-runtime&lt;/a&gt; library uses a completely different approach. Like typescript-json-schema, it processes your existing TypeScript code. However, instead of generating some kind of schemas, it actually transpiles the code into equivalent code that contains runtime type checks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say that we start from the following TypeScript code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Person&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;firstName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;lastName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Person&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;firstName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Foo&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;lastName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Bar&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;55&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we run ts-runtime on this code, we get the following transpiled code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;ts-runtime/lib&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Person&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Person&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;property&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;firstName&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()),&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;property&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;lastName&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()),&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;property&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;age&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;test&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ref&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Person&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;firstName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Foo&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;lastName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Bar&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;55&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A drawback of this approach is that you have no control over the locations where the type checking happens: every type check is converted into a runtime type check. This is typically overkill, as you only need runtime type checking at the boundaries of your program to check input structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also note that this library is currently still in an experimental stage and not recommended for production use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;combining-runtime-and-static-type-assertion-using-io-ts&quot;&gt;Combining runtime and static type assertion using io-ts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where ts-runtime generates runtime type checks based on static ones, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gcanti/io-ts&quot;&gt;io-ts&lt;/a&gt; takes the opposite approach. You use this library to define runtime type checks, which look very similar to the ones generated by ts-runtime, and the library actually allows TypeScript to infer the corresponding static types automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what our &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt; type looks like in io-ts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;io-ts&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;PersonType&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;firstName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;lastName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;refinement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Positive'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that, like in our JSON Schemas example, we added the restriction that the person’s age should be at least zero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our code, we can use this runtime type to check input against the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt; type. Once we have defined this runtime type, we can also extract the corresponding static type from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Person&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;TypeOf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;PersonType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above code is equivalent to our regular interface definition:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Person&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;firstName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;lastName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a very nice approach for working with interfaces. Because the static types are inferred from the runtime types, both kinds of types do not get out of sync when you are changing your code. The library also allows for a lot of flexibility when defining types, including the definition of recursive types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A drawback of io-ts is that it requires you to define your types as io-ts runtime types, which does not work when you are defining classes. One way to handle this could be to define an interface using io-ts and then make the class implement the interface. However, this means you need to make sure to update the io-ts type whenever you are adding properties to your class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that your code specifies interfaces as io-ts types rather than plain TypeScript interfaces can also be a drawback. While plain TypeScript interfaces can easily be shared, for example between backend and frontend, this becomes harder to achieve with io-ts types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-typescript-alternative-to-javas-bean-validation&quot;&gt;A TypeScript alternative to Java’s Bean Validation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a final candidate, I am including the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/typestack/class-validator&quot;&gt;class-validator&lt;/a&gt; library. This library uses decorators on class properties, making it very similar to Java’s JSR-380 Bean Validation 2.0 (implemented by, for example, Hibernate Validator). It is part of a family of libraries that also includes &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm&quot;&gt;typeorm&lt;/a&gt; (ORM, similar to Java’s JPA) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/typestack/routing-controllers&quot;&gt;routing-controllers&lt;/a&gt; (similar to Java’s JAX-RS for defining APIs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example, consider the following code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;plainToClass&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;class-transformer&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;validate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;IsString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;IsInt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Min&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;class-validator&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Person&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;IsString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;firstName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;IsString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;lastName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;IsInt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;Min&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;any&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;firstName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Foo&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;inputAsClassInstance&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;plainToClass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Person&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Person&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;validate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;inputAsClassInstance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;errors&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// handle errors if needed&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that class-validator needs actual class instances to work on. Here, we used its sister library class-transformer to transform our plain input into an actual &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt; instance. That transformation in itself does not perform any kind of type checking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach works well with classes, but setting up classes with the decorators that class-validator needs and converting the objects you receive to instances of those classes can feel like overkill if all you need to check is a simple interface. You may want to consider other approaches, like for example the one using io-ts.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="typescript" /><category term="javascript" /><summary type="html">This post will discuss some possibilities for adding runtime type checking to TypeScript applications.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Lambda expressions in Java</title><link href="http://0.0.0.0:4000/2019/01/05/Lambda-expressions-Java/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Lambda expressions in Java" /><published>2019-01-05T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-01-05T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://0.0.0.0:4000/2019/01/05/Lambda-expressions-Java</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://0.0.0.0:4000/2019/01/05/Lambda-expressions-Java/">&lt;p&gt;In this post, we cover the lambda expressions which were added to the Java language in version 8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lambda-expressions&quot;&gt;Lambda expressions?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before diving into the specifics of lambda expressions in Java, it’s probably not a bad idea to have a look at lambda expressions. What exactly is such a lambda expression?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;lambda expression&lt;/em&gt; is a general concept in programming that is a synonym for &lt;em&gt;anonymous function&lt;/em&gt;. This indicates a function (a piece of code that accepts input, does something with it and potentially returns a result) that is not explicitly named. These anonymous functions are very useful for passing them around to be used as input for other functions that operate on functions. For example, let’s say we have an anonymous function comparing two strings and returning a number indicating their relative order. You could then pass that as input to another function that sorts a list of strings according the order specified by the anonymous function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anonymous functions were first described in a paper by Alonzo Church, written in 1936, before electronic computers even existed. In that paper, the parameters for the anonymous systems were marked using the letter λ (lambda). He picked this letter because the classic work &lt;em&gt;Principia Mathematica&lt;/em&gt;, a very important work in the field of mathematics released about 20 years earlier, used the ^ accent to mark function parameters, which kind of looked like an uppercase lambda (Λ).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-java-supports-lambda-expressions&quot;&gt;How Java supports lambda expressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of diving deeper into the history of computer programming, let’s fast-forward to modern Java and the way it supports the use of lambda expressions since version 8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s have a first look at lambda expressions with a simple example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;first&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;second&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;first&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;second&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, it simply consist of some code to execute (the body of the expression), together with the input parameters. You don’t need to specify the return type of the body: Java automatically infers it. If the body doesn’t fit on one line, simply create a block for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;first&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;second&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;first&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;second&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;())&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;first&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;second&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;())&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lambda expression we just described take two Strings as parameters and return an integer. This means that they conform to the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Comparator&amp;lt;String&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; interface. By specifying this, Java can infer the types of the parameters and you don’t need to specify them explicitly anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;compareStrings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Comparator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;comp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;comp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;compare&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;string1&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;string2&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;compareStrings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;first&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;second&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;first&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;second&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there is only a single argument with an inferred type, we can even omit the parentheses around that argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;functional-interfaces&quot;&gt;Functional interfaces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last example, we really saw lambda expressions in action: we have a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;compareStrings&lt;/code&gt;
function taking a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Comparator&amp;lt;String&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and we invoke it by passing an anonymous function conforming to that interface. We cannot do this for just any interface. The special thing about the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Comparator&amp;lt;String&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; interface is that it has a single abstract method (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;compare&lt;/code&gt; in this case). Such an interface is called a &lt;em&gt;functional interface&lt;/em&gt;. Whenever a piece of code needs an object conforming to a functional interface, you can pass a lambda expression implementing the single abstract method of that interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the introduction of lambda expressions, Java also supplied a collection of new predefined functional interfaces in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/function/package-summary.html&quot;&gt;java.util.function&lt;/a&gt; package. These are some general interfaces specifically intended to describe common signatures for lambda expressions. The interfaces use the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@FunctionalInterface&lt;/code&gt; annotation to indicate that they are indeed functional interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example of such an interface is the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Predicate&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; interface, which takes an object of type &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; and returns a boolean value. Because it is a functional interface, it has a single abstract method. However, like several other functional interfaces, it has some (static or non-static) non-abstract methods intended for creating and combining functions. For example, if we have two &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Predicate&lt;/code&gt; instances &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;predicate1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;predicate2&lt;/code&gt;, we can combine them into a new &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Predicate&lt;/code&gt; as &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;predicate1.and(predicate2)&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Predicate&lt;/code&gt; interface also offers a static factory method &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;isEqual(other)&lt;/code&gt; which returning a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Predicate&lt;/code&gt; that compares its parameter to the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;other&lt;/code&gt; object using its &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;equals&lt;/code&gt; method (but doesn’t throw a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NullPointerException&lt;/code&gt; if &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;other&lt;/code&gt; is null).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Predicate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;testPred&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Predicate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;isEqual&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;testPred&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;test&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// false&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;testPred&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also several other interfaces in the Java standard library which are functional interfaces. Examples are &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;java.util.Comparator&lt;/code&gt;, which we saw above, and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;java.lang.Runnable&lt;/code&gt;. These specific ones are also marked with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@FunctionalInterface&lt;/code&gt;, but note that that is not required to make an interface an actual interface. Any interface with a single abstract method is a functional interface. The only thing the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@FunctionalInterface&lt;/code&gt; annotation does is that it makes this explicit (also in generated documentation) and causes the compiler to check if there is indeed only a single abstract method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it is considered good practice to use existing functional interfaces where possible, you can also define your own functional interfaces. This is mostly useful if you need to accept lambda expressions with some uncommon signature. An example of this is an expression taking two &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; values and returning an instance of a custom &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Color&lt;/code&gt; class. You could in principle use the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;BiFunction&amp;lt;Integer, Integer, Color&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; interface, but you can avoid automatic boxing ad unboxing between &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Integer&lt;/code&gt; by specifying your own function interface. Another use case could be an expression taking a String and potentially throwing a checked exception, which should then be declared on the abstract method of the functional interface. If you create a custom functional interface, don’t forget to mark it using the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@FunctionalInterface&lt;/code&gt; annotation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lambda-expression-scope&quot;&gt;Lambda expression scope&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we already saw, lambda expressions take inputs in the form of parameters. However, a lambda expression’s parameters are not the only way to pass data to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The body of a lambda expression has the same scope as a nested block (say, for example, the block of an if-statement). This means that, inside a lambda expression, you cannot declare a variable with the same name as a variable in the enclosing scope. It also means that, if you use the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; keyword inside a lambda expression, it denotes the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; reference of the method creating the lambda. One consequence is that lambda expressions cannot call default methods of the interface they implement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Test&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;    
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;instanceVariable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Predicate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;getPredicate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;localVariable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;localVariable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// compiler error&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;localVariable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// 10&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;instanceVariable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// 1&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;localVariable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As demonstrated in the above example, lambda expressions allow you to access variables from the enclosing scope (the method creating the lambda expression). This may seem obvious, but something special is going on there. Our lambda expression will be executed when the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;getPredicate()&lt;/code&gt; method creating it has already completed and the local variables inside that method are gone. How does this work?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, we saw that a lambda expression consists of a block of code and parameters for that block of code. In addition to that, the lambda expression that is passed around also contains values for the &lt;em&gt;free variables&lt;/em&gt; (variables that are not parameters and are not defined inside the lambda expression’s code). When storing a lambda expression in a variable, the object representing the lambda expression also includes the values of these free variables. Such a combination of a block of code together with the values of free variables is called a &lt;em&gt;closure&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Java, the capturing of free variables has an important restriction: you can only capture variables that are &lt;em&gt;effectively final&lt;/em&gt;. This means that the variables don’t change; either they are declared &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;final&lt;/code&gt; or they could have been declared &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;final&lt;/code&gt;. This also means that it is not possible to reassign captured variables from the lambda expression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;localVariable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;++)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;predicates&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;localVariable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;++;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// compiler error&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// compiler error&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;localVariable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// ok&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This restriction on captured variables is specific to Java. For example, closures in JavaScript do allow changing variables in the enclosing code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that, while you cannot change the values of captured variables, you can still call methods on them if they are objects. It can also be interesting to know that the variable of an enhanced &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loop is effectively final because its scope is limited to a singe iteration of the loop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;List&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Integer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;integers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;List&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Integer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;processedIntegers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Integer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;integer:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;integers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;predicates&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;processedIntegers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;integer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;integer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;java-as-a-somewhat-functional-language&quot;&gt;Java as a (somewhat) functional language&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the introduction of lambda expressions and functional interfaces, Java gains some capabilities that are typical for functional programming languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lambda expressions and functional interfaces can be seen as a way to treat functions as first-class objects, allowing to store functions in variables or pass them around to functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This way, Java supports the creation of &lt;em&gt;higher-order functions&lt;/em&gt;, which are methods/functions that process or return other functions (although, in reality, those functions are just objects of classes implementing a functional interface). An example of this would be a static method that accepts a boolean indicating a direction and returns a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Comparator&lt;/code&gt; based on the input. We could also have a method that takes a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Comparator&lt;/code&gt; and returns a new &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Comparator&lt;/code&gt; reversing the order of the initial &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Comparator&lt;/code&gt; (the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Comparator&lt;/code&gt; interface actually has a default method &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;reversed()&lt;/code&gt; which reverses the current &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Comparator&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Java now also has a powerful mechanism to pass regular methods around as objects, which is essentially a shorthand for writing lambda expressions invoking the same methods. This is the mechanism of &lt;em&gt;method references&lt;/em&gt;. There are three variations here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Class::staticMethod&lt;/em&gt;: a reference to a static method of a class&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Class::instanceMethod&lt;/em&gt;: a reference to an instance method of a class. The first argument specifies the object on which the instance method is invoked.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;object::instanceMethod&lt;/em&gt;: a reference to an instance method of a class which will be invoked an a specific object.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Test&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;    
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;staticMethod&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;static:&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;instanceMethod&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;instance:&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// method reference&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;Test:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;staticMethod&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// equivalent lambda expression&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;staticMethod&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// method reference&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;Test:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;instanceMethod&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// equivalent lambda expression (2 parameters!)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;instance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;instance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;instanceMethod&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Test&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;testInstance&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// method reference&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;testInstance:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;instanceMethod&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// equivalent lambda expression&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;testInstance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;instanceMethod&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some more realistic examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;List&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ArrayList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
        
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Class::staticMethod&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;removeIf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;Objects:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;isNull&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Class::instanceMethod&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;sort&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;String:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;compareToIgnoreCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// object::instanceMethod&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;forEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As another practical example, consider the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Comparator.comparing&lt;/code&gt; method. This method takes a method reference that extracts the values to compare. This allows for easy construction of custom &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Comparator&lt;/code&gt; instances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;personList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;sort&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Comparator&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;comparing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;Person:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;getLastName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;thenComparing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;Person:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;getFirstName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a similar mechanism, &lt;em&gt;constructor references&lt;/em&gt;, for passing around constructors. This uses the syntax &lt;em&gt;Class::new&lt;/em&gt;. If there are multiple constructors, the compiler will infer which constructor to use from the context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;    
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Max&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// no-argument constructor&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Supplier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dogSupplier&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;Dog:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// String argument constructor&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;nameToDog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;Dog:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also use constructor references to construct arrays. In that case, the array size is determined by the single parameter passed to the constructor reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;alternatives-to-lambda-expressions&quot;&gt;Alternatives to lambda expressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the introduction of lambda expressions, Java already had a concise way to define a class implementing an interface. The way to do this was to use local or anonymous classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;local class&lt;/em&gt; is a class defined inside a method. A typical use case is if you want to provide an object conforming to an interface and it doesn’t really matter what the implementing class is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;localVariable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;LengthPredicate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;implements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Predicate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@Override&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;localVariable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Predicate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;predicate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;LengthPredicate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you use your local class only once, it makes more sense to remove the name and to define it as an &lt;em&gt;anonymous class&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;localVariable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;        

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Predicate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;predicate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Predicate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@Override&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;localVariable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like with lambda expressions, the code in local and anonymous classes can access local variables defined in their enclosing scope. Also just like with lambda expressions, this is only allowed if those local variables are effectively final.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are, however, some important differences between lambda expressions and local/anonymous classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, you can use local/anonymous classes to implement interfaces with more than one abstract method. You are not restricted to functional interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;TwoMethodInterface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;methodA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;methodB&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;TwoMethodInterface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;twoMethodInterface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;TwoMethodInterface&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@Override&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;methodA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;methodA&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@Override&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;methodB&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;methodB&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second difference is that local/anonymous classes actually allow you to define local variables with the same name as local variables in the enclosing scope. This hides the variable in the enclosing scope from the code in the local/anonymous class (this is called &lt;em&gt;shadowing&lt;/em&gt;). Lambda expressions forbid this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;localVariable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;        

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Predicate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;predicate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Predicate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@Override&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;localVariable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// 10&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;localVariable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;    
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;localVariable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// 1&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;localVariable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important thing to note is that local/anonymous classes are actual classes. Unlike lambda expressions, they can define and access their own instance variables. This also means that, if you use the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; keyword in a method of a local/anonymous class, it refers to the instance of the class itself and not to the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; reference of the method creating the local/anonymous class. You can also call default methods on the interface that you are implementing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;InterfaceA&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;    
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;abstract&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;doSomething&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;logCount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;InterfaceA&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;interfaceA&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;InterfaceA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;count&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@Override&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;doSomething&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;++;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;logCount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this can be useful, it does make it harder to access the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; reference of the enclosing method. However, we can still access that &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; reference by using local variables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Test&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;    
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;instanceVariable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;getInstanceVariable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;instanceVariable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// using method reference&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IntSupplier&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;supplier&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;getInstanceVariable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// using a local variable referring to this&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Test&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;outer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// available from Java 10&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// also works if this is instance of anonymous class&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;outer2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;InterfaceA&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;interfaceA&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;InterfaceA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;            
            &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@Override&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;doSomething&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;outerInstanceVariable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;supplier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;getAsInt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;outer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;instanceVariable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;++;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
        
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;interfaceA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;doSomething&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;functional-interfaces-and-instantiation&quot;&gt;Functional interfaces and instantiation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lambda expressions can be used as the value for variables or parameters that have a functional interface as a type. So, does this mean that lambda expressions violate the rule that interfaces cannot be directly instantiated?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, not quite. When you write a lambda expression, Java uses that to create an instance of some class that implements the relevant functional interface. This is similar to what happens when using an anonymous class. The way these objects and classes are managed depends on the specific Java implementation and can be highly optimized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to see this in action, let’s use a lambda expression and an anonymous class to fill a variable that has a functional interface as its type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Predicate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pred1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Predicate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pred2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Predicate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@Override&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// class misc.Main$$Lambda$1/834600351&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pred1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;getClass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-idea-behind-interfaces&quot;&gt;The idea behind interfaces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interfaces have been around since the first version of Java. The main idea behind interfaces is that they are a way to specify the contract between supplier(s) of certain functionality and client code which uses that functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most common use case for interfaces is to define an interface declaring one or more abstract methods (without implementation). There may be several classes actually implementing the interface (and specifying concrete implementations for the methods). Client code can then require an object that conforms to a certain interface, without having to care about which implementing class the object is an instance of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially, Java interfaces could only contain two kinds of members: public static constants and public abstract methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;    
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;CONSTANT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;    
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;abstract&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;doSomething&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In version 2, it became possible to include nested classes and interfaces as well (although this is often not considered good practice). Java 5 introduced generics and the new enum an annotation types. This meant that interfaces could then also be parameterized with type parameters and that they could contain nested enums and annotations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we forget about nested classes, interfaces, enums and annotations for a moment (they are not used very often anyway), not much had changed since the first version. Interfaces were still all about declaring public static constants and public abstract methods. This all changed in Java 8 and later versions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;interfaces-in-modern-java&quot;&gt;Interfaces in modern Java&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Java 8 introduced streams. This means that, starting from Java 8, every class implementing the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Collection&lt;/code&gt; interface now has a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.stream()&lt;/code&gt; method that provides powerful tools for processing and transforming the collection and its contents. Now, if that method would have been added to the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Collection&lt;/code&gt; interface as an abstract method, this would have meant that all of the custom &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Collection&lt;/code&gt; classes that people had implemented would fail to compile until their authors added that &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.stream()&lt;/code&gt; method. Additionally, if such a class was supplied in a JAR file (for example, a  reusable library) that was compiled with an earlier version of Java, the class would still load successfully but users would suddenly get runtime errors on calling the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.stream()&lt;/code&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was one of the reasons for the introduction of &lt;em&gt;default methods&lt;/em&gt; in Java 8 interfaces. A default method is a method defined in an interface that specifies an actual implementation. A class implementing the interface can choose to either use that implementation (this is the case by default) or override it with custom code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Java 8, the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.stream()&lt;/code&gt; method was added to the  &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Collection&lt;/code&gt; interface as a default method. This means that classes that don’t specify anything regarding the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.stream()&lt;/code&gt; method will still continue to work without any changes. They will just use the default implementation of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.stream()&lt;/code&gt; that is specified in the interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Collection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Iterable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// ...    &lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Stream&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;stream&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; 
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// default implementation&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;//...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Default methods are also a clean alternative to the widespread pattern of declaring an interface (with only abstract methods) and then offering an abstract companion class providing default implementations for most of the methods. An example of that pattern is the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Collection&lt;/code&gt; interface, for which there is an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;AbstractCollection&lt;/code&gt; class providing default implementations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to default methods, modern Java now also allows interfaces to specify static methods and private methods (introduced in Java 9). Static methods in interfaces can be useful as factory methods. We will see examples of this in an upcoming article on lambda expressions. Private methods are useful as helper methods for the default methods specified in the interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;abstract-classes-vs-interfaces&quot;&gt;Abstract classes vs. interfaces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As interfaces have become more powerful, they have become more similar to abstract classes. Therefore, it can be interesting to have a look at the remaining differences between the two in order to get a feel for when to use which.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One big limitation (by design) of interfaces is that they cannot be instantiated. Every object, although it could conform to one or more interfaces and could even be casted to the type of those interfaces, has to be an instance of an actual class. This also means that, unlike abstract classes, interfaces cannot have any instance variables or constructors. Interfaces are made for specifying behavior, not for encapsulating state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another limitation of interfaces is that the static variables they can declare will always be &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;final&lt;/code&gt; (constant). This means that nothing, including the interface’s own static methods, can modify them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important feature of interfaces is that, while a class can only extend at most one class, a class can implement any number of interfaces. This makes sense, as an interface is intended to specify a contract and a class could potentially conform to multiple contracts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;default-methods-and-inheritance&quot;&gt;Default methods and inheritance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we saw above, a class can implement multiple interfaces. Before version 8 of Java, this was straightforward: as interfaces could not contain any kind of implementation code, it was impossible for implementation code from different interfaces to conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since default methods were introduced, this is no longer the case. Now, let’s say that we have class that implements two interfaces, both of which contain a default method &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;doSomething()&lt;/code&gt;. At that point, it becomes unclear which implementation should be used if the class does not specify its own implementation. This is known as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_inheritance#The_diamond_problem&quot;&gt;diamond problem&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Java team has chosen to play it safe: if two interfaces that a class implements specify a method with the same signature and at least one of them specifies a default implementation for that method, the class must specify its own implementation. Even if only one of the interfaces provides a default implementation, the compiler forces you to be explicit about the specific implementation to be used. If one of the default methods already specifies the behavior you want, your implementation can simply delegate to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;InterfaceA&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;    
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;abstract&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;doSomething&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;InterfaceB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;    
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;doSomething&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;test&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;implements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;InterfaceA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;InterfaceB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// compiler forces us to provide an implementation&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@Override&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;doSomething&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// delegate to behavior specified in InterfaceB&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;InterfaceB&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;doSomething&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, what if a class inherits from a superclass specifying a method &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;doSomething()&lt;/code&gt; but also implements an interface that specifies a default &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;doSomething()&lt;/code&gt; method? Here, the answer is simple: classes always win. In this case, Java will use the implementation defined in the superclass and simply ignore the default method implementation. This rule makes sure that default methods don’t suddenly change the behavior of code that was written before Java 8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, remember that there cannot possibly be a conflict between method implementations from two superclasses, because a class can still only inherit from at most one superclass.&lt;/p&gt;

Although the post focuses on Java, some general ideas can be applied to other languages as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;checked-versus-unchecked-exceptions&quot;&gt;Checked versus unchecked exceptions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Java, there is an important distinction between checked and unchecked exceptions. The way you deal with checked exceptions is checked by the compiler. If you write a method and perform a call that can potentially throw a checked exception, the compiler forces you to either catch the exception or add the exception to the signature of your method using a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;throws&lt;/code&gt; declaration. This is not the case for unchecked exceptions: the compiler does not care whether you handle them or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Checked exceptions are intended for cases when there is a reasonable way of recovering from the failure during the execution of the program. An example is a call to open a file and write to it, which can fail if the file does not exist. A reasonable way of recovering from this is trying a different filename. If the code for opening the file throws a checked exception if the file does not exist, the compiler forces you to to decide what to do in that case. This prevents you from forgetting that this kind of failure can actually happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unchecked exceptions are intended to be used for programming errors. A simple example is &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NullPointerException&lt;/code&gt;: this exception is thrown when the code attempts to execute a method on a null reference, which will never occur in ideal bug-free code. Typically, there is no reasonable way to recover from these kinds of programming errors at runtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a school of thought that uses a slightly different set of guidelines:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use checked exceptions if there is a reasonable way of recovering from the failure during the execution of the program &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; the possibility for failure is unavoidable (an example is a missing file: even if you checked for its existence before, the file can still have disappeared in the meantime).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use unchecked exceptions in all other cases.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Evaluate these conditions at every level in the call chain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, there is a different and popular school of thought which uses the following single guideline:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Always use unchecked exceptions. Never use checked exceptions (unless you are maybe writing a very critical library).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That last school of thought is advertised in, amongst others, the &lt;em&gt;Clean Code&lt;/em&gt; book by Robert C. Martin. The reasoning behind this is that checked exceptions come at a high cost. The cost is the fact that, if you throw a checked exception from your code and the appropriate handler sits three levels higher in the call chain, you must declare the exception on every method in between. This means that a single change to a small method somewhere deep in the program can require the signature of several higher-level methods to change, breaking encapsulation and coupling the handler of the exception to the code that generates it. This actually negates a large benefit of exceptions, which is that you can decouple the code detecting a failure from the code handling the failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The people coming from that school of thought argue that the benefits of checked exceptions do not outweigh these costs. The main benefit of checked exceptions is robustness, but checked exceptions are not a requirement for robustness. It is perfectly possible to write robust software in other languages (like C#) that do not offer checked exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;throw-early-catch-late&quot;&gt;Throw early, catch late&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A general best practice regarding exceptions is “Throw early, catch late”. This can roughly be translated to “Don’t catch an exception unless you are in the best position to do something useful with it”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if an exception occurs because there is no file at a specific path, it often makes sense to propagate the exception up to the level where the path to use is determined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, you should only catch exceptions if:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can perform a useful action on the exception (possibly just logging) and then rethrow it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can wrap the exception into a new exception that makes more sense to your caller and throw that new exception.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can make a final decision regarding what must happen to fully handle the exception.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;providing-context-with-exceptions&quot;&gt;Providing context with exceptions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although exceptions contain a stack trace that shows the call chain at the time the exception occurred, it is often advisable to pass additional context. Typically, you should at least provide a meaningful message explaining the intent of the operation that failed and the reason for failure. When defining custom exception classes, you can also foresee additional data being stored with the exception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your application has logging, your exception (including stack trace) should contain enough information for creating a meaningful log message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;client-first-design-for-exception-classes&quot;&gt;Client-first design for exception classes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When designing which and how many exception classes you need, try to consider the point of view of the caller. It is possible that things can go wrong because of different reasons but the caller only has one reasonable way of handling failures, independent of the specific reason. In that case, a good approach is typically to foresee a single exception class, potentially using exception chaining to pass on more details. You only need different error classes if the client needs to handle them differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are using a class with methods that can throw lots of different exception types, consider wrapping it in a class that delegates actual functionality to the wrapped class but catches a set of specific errors and wraps these into a single, more general error class. This is one of the techniques you can use to transform a library’s interface into an interface that makes more sense to your application, decoupling your application from the interface that the library provides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;wrapped&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Type1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Type2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Type3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;WrappedException&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dealing-with-nullpointerexception&quot;&gt;Dealing with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NullPointerException&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most dreaded Java exception types is the infamous &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NullPointerException&lt;/code&gt;. This is an unchecked exception indicating a programming error (we called a method on a null reference). The best way of dealing with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NullPointerException&lt;/code&gt; is to avoid it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can make failure with a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NullPointerException&lt;/code&gt; less likely by using the following set of rules for your code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t return null from methods. Wherever possible, return a special case object (e.g. an empty list, which you can easily obtain from &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Collections.emptyList()&lt;/code&gt;, or an instance of a dedicated class that was intended for these cases).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t pass null as a method parameter. In some other languages, for example TypeScript, the compiler can actually help you enforce this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Objects&lt;/code&gt; class has some convenient methods for preventing problems with null pointers. These can be used for checking arguments or preventing passing null.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Objects.requireNonNull()&lt;/code&gt; throws a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NullPointerException&lt;/code&gt; if the argument is null and returns the argument itself otherwise. This does not prevent the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NullPointerException&lt;/code&gt; from being thrown. However, the benefit here is that we throw it where the source of the problem lies (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; being passed where it is not allowed) instead of at some later point in the code where we try to invoke a method on a null reference.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Objects.requireNonNullElse()&lt;/code&gt; returns either the first parameter or, if the first parameter is null, it returns the second parameter. It is quite similar to the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;COALESCE&lt;/code&gt; function in SQL.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;nickName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Objects&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;requireNonNull&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;nickName&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Objects&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;requireNonNullElse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;nickName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;nick&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something else that can help is the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Optional&lt;/code&gt; type, which will likely be discussed in a later blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

This post explains the tools Java provides you for handling errors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;errors-and-exceptions&quot;&gt;Errors and exceptions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a method encounters a situation that prevents it from doing what it should do, it needs some way to make the caller of the method aware of this. One way of doing this is to return an error code if something went wrong. If the caller gets back an error code, it can then respond accordingly, possibly propagating the error to its own caller with an error code. A big drawback of this is that the caller must remember to check for error codes and then do something with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an alternative to this, Java and a lot of other modern languages support the concept of &lt;em&gt;exception handling&lt;/em&gt;. Here, a method can throw an exception indicating that something is wrong. These exceptions automatically bubble up the call chain until they are handled (or, if they are not handled, they end up terminating the current thread). Typically, they include a stack trace, indicating where the exception occurred in the code and what the call chain looked like at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Java, there are several kinds of exceptions. The following image describes what the general hierarchy of exception classes in Java looks like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2018-12-15-Java-exception-handling/exception-hierarchy.png&quot; alt=&quot;Exception hierarchy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All exceptions are direct or indirect subclasses of the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Throwable&lt;/code&gt; class. Subclasses of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Error&lt;/code&gt; are exceptions defined by the Java language that are thrown when something really bad happens that the code can normally not recover from by itself. An example of this is &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;OutOfMemoryError&lt;/code&gt;, which occurs when Java is unable to allocate space to an object because there is no more memory available and garbage collection does not help. If you run into that one, the best you can generally do is exit the program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Error&lt;/code&gt; exceptions are all unchecked. This means that the Java compiler does not check how we deal with these exceptions. This is different for checked exceptions: if your code can possibly throw a checked exception, the Java compiler requires you to either catch the exception or use a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;throws&lt;/code&gt; declaration to indicate that your code can throw the exception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;User-defined exceptions are all subclasses of the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Exception&lt;/code&gt; class. Exception classes that directly derive from &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Exception&lt;/code&gt; are checked exceptions. Exception classes that derive from &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;RuntimeException&lt;/code&gt; are unchecked exceptions. The name &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;RuntimeException&lt;/code&gt; could be a bit confusing, as all exceptions occur at runtime. The idea is that, unlike checked exceptions, the way you handle unchecked exceptions is not checked at &lt;em&gt;compile&lt;/em&gt; time (hence the “runtime”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;throwing-and-the-throws-declaration&quot;&gt;Throwing and the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;throws&lt;/code&gt; declaration&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throwing an exception is as easy as obtaining an instance of the exception and throwing it. An example is the following code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;isNumberBetween&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;lower&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;upper&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;lower&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;upper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;IllegalArgumentException&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Lower bound cannot be higher than upper bound&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, we were throwing an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;IllegalArgumentException&lt;/code&gt;, which is unchecked. This means we do not need to declare (using a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;throws&lt;/code&gt; declaration) that the method can throw an exception of that type, although we can choose to declare it explicitly. The above code is an example of using unchecked exceptions to indicate programming errors: it never makes sense for the caller of this method to specify a lower bound that is higher than the upper bound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the code in a method can throw a checked exception, your code will not compile until you declare it. One example of a checked exception is &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;IOException&lt;/code&gt;, which you will encounter a lot when working with files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// error: Unhandled exception type IOException&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;write&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;filePath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// potentially throws IOException&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Files&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;write&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Paths&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;filePath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;getBytes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can fix the compiler error by either catching the IOException or declaring it using a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;throws&lt;/code&gt; clause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;write&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;filePath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;throws&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IOException&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Files&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;write&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Paths&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;filePath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;getBytes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a way for the compiler to remind us that there is a possibility for failures and that we will have to deal with those failures at some point in the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you override a method, you cannot throw more checked exceptions than the original &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;throws&lt;/code&gt; clause specifies. Otherwise, you would break the contract of the method. This also means that, if a method does not have a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;throws&lt;/code&gt; clause, any method overriding it cannot throw any checked exceptions. Note that you can perfectly override a method declaring checked exceptions with a method not throwing any exceptions at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, it is always allowed to include checked exceptions in your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;throws&lt;/code&gt; clause that you don’t actually use. This may be useful in a superclass that needs to allow subclasses to throw these checked exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;catching-exceptions&quot;&gt;Catching exceptions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to handle an exception, you first need to catch it. Catching an exception allows your code to detect when the exception occurs and prevents the exception from bubbling up further through the call chain (although you can still trigger this yourself, see later).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Catching an exception happens in a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;try-catch&lt;/code&gt; block. In its simplest form, it looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// code potentially throwing exception&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;TheExceptionClass&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// code handling the exception&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also have multiple catch statements, catching exceptions of different exception classes. They are evaluated top to bottom, so put more specific exception classes first.
It is also possible to have a handler that can handle several exception classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// code potentially throwing exception&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ExceptionClass1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// code handling the exception&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ExceptionClass2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ExceptionClass3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// code handling the exception&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cleaning-up-using-try-with-resources&quot;&gt;Cleaning up using try-with-resources&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One challenge regarding exception handling is the cleanup of resources. For example, if you have opened a file and an exception occurs while doing something with it, you should make sure that the file is still being closed at some point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Java, one way to solve this is called a &lt;em&gt;try-with-resources&lt;/em&gt; statement. In this form of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;try&lt;/code&gt; statement, you can specify resources that should be closed automatically. The fact that a resource can be closed automatically is indicated by the fact that it implements the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;AutoCloseable&lt;/code&gt; interface. As an example, look at the following code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;write&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ArrayList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;lines&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;throws&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;FileNotFoundException&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;PrintWriter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;PrintWriter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;output.txt&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;line:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;lines&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;possiblyGenerateException&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;line&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;line&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the code exits the try block, either because we finished processing the lines or an exception was thrown inside, the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;PrintWriter&lt;/code&gt; will be closed automatically. It is also possible to provide multiple resources to a try-with-resources statement. In that case, the order in which they are closed is the reverse of the order in which they were provided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A try-with-resources statement can also have catch clauses catching any exceptions occurring in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible that closing an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;AutoCloseable&lt;/code&gt; throws an exception itself. If that happens after normal execution of the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;try&lt;/code&gt; block, that exception is passed to the caller. However, if an exception happens inside the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;try&lt;/code&gt; block, that exception will be passed to the caller and any exceptions generated by subsequently closing the resources will be attached as &lt;em&gt;suppressed exceptions&lt;/em&gt; on that exception. When catching the exception that happened in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;try&lt;/code&gt; block (the &lt;em&gt;primary exception&lt;/em&gt;), you can access those suppressed exceptions by invoking the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;getSuppressed()&lt;/code&gt; method on the caught exception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;ThrowsOnClose&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;implements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;AutoCloseable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@Override&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;close&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;IllegalStateException&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Closing&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ThrowsOnClose&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;throwsOnClose&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ThrowsOnClose&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;())&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;IllegalArgumentException&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Inside try&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Exception&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;getMessage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;());&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Inside try&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Throwable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;suppressed:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;getSuppressed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;())&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;suppressed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;getMessage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;());&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Closing&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cleaning-up-using-finally&quot;&gt;Cleaning up using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;finally&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An alternative to the try-with-resources statement is the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;finally&lt;/code&gt; clause. This is especially useful if you need to clean up something that is not an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;AutoCloseable&lt;/code&gt;. After the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;try&lt;/code&gt; block and potential &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; blocks, you add a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;finally block&lt;/code&gt; which will run after the rest of the try-catch statement has finished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should avoid throwing exceptions in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;finally&lt;/code&gt; block. If the code in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;try&lt;/code&gt; block throws an exception and then the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;finally&lt;/code&gt; block throws an exception, the caller of the method will only see the exception from the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;finally&lt;/code&gt; block. The suppression mechanism we saw above only works with try-with-resources statements. For example, a caller of the method below will only see the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;IllegalStateException&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;IllegalArgumentException&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;finally&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;            
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;IllegalStateException&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;rethrowing-and-chaining&quot;&gt;Rethrowing and chaining&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible that your code wants to do something with an exception (for example, log it) but still wants the exception to bubble up further through the call chain. In this case, you can simple catch the exception, do what you want to do with it, and then just throw the exception object that you caught.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also possible catch a certain exception and throw a new exception instead. In this case, the original exception is typically included as the cause for the new exception. This is called the &lt;em&gt;chaining&lt;/em&gt; of exceptions. As an example, the following code catches a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SQLException&lt;/code&gt; but returns it to the caller as the cause for a custom exception which makes more sense to the caller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// set foreign key to parent in database&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;SQLException&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;            
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;ParentNotFoundException&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the caller catches the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ParentNotFoundException&lt;/code&gt;, it can find the original exception using the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;getCause()&lt;/code&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ParentNotFoundException&lt;/code&gt; has a constructor which allows passing the cause (this is considered good practice). If an exception class does not allow that, the cause for the exception can be set through the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;initCause()&lt;/code&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// set foreign key to parent in database&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;SQLException&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Throwable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;wrapped&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ParentNotFoundException&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;wrapped&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;initCause&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;     
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;wrapped&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;turning-checked-exceptions-into-unchecked-exceptions&quot;&gt;Turning checked exceptions into unchecked exceptions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some cases, you may find yourself getting a checked exception which you want to pass up the method chain as an unchecked exception (for example because you are overriding a method without a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;throws&lt;/code&gt; declaration allowing the checked exception).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way of doing is the chaining of exceptions, which we saw above. It is perfectly possible to catch a checked exception, set that exception as the cause for a new unchecked exception and then throw the unchecked exception to the caller. In the above examples, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ParentNotFoundException&lt;/code&gt; could have been an unchecked exception. This is the recommended way of turning checked exceptions into unchecked exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There also exist sneaky approaches that trick the Java compiler into ignoring checked exceptions. An example is the following implementation which I took from &lt;em&gt;Core Java SE 9 for the Impatient&lt;/em&gt; (see resources below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Exceptions&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@SuppressWarnings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;unchecked&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Throwable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
            &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;throwAs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Throwable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;throws&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// erased to (Throwable) e&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;V&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;V&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;doWork&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Callable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;V&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Throwable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Exceptions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;RuntimeException&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;throwAs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, any checked exceptions thrown inside the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;doWork&lt;/code&gt; method are ignored by the compiler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// error: unhandled FileNotFoundException&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;PrintWriter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;output.txt&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; 

    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// ok&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Exceptions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;doWork&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
            &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;PrintWriter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;output.txt&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although this is a pretty cool trick, it is not generally applicable in practice. Not only would it be confusing to catch an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;IOException&lt;/code&gt; from a method that doesn’t declare it, but the compiler does not even allow you to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;invokeTest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IOException&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// error: unreachable catch block&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;        
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Exceptions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;doWork&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
            &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;PrintWriter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;output.txt&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some limited use cases where it could make sense to use this trick (although they are not necessarily considered good practice). The first one is if you are creating a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Runnable&lt;/code&gt; that can throw a checked exception in its &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;run()&lt;/code&gt; method (which does not declare any checked exceptions). You can define custom error handling behavior for the thread (for both checked and unchecked exceptions) in the thread’s uncaught exception handler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;TestRunnable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;implements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Runnable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@Override&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Exceptions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;doWork&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;PrintWriter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;unwritableFile&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Thread&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Thread&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;TestRunnable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
        
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;setUncaughtExceptionHandler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;UncaughtExceptionHandler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@Override&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;uncaughtException&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Thread&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Throwable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;instanceof&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IOException&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Caught IOException&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Caught IOException&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another case where it could make sense to use this method is when dealing with “impossible” exceptions. There are some methods in the standard library with a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;throws&lt;/code&gt; clause declaring checked exceptions, although there are some sets of arguments which are &lt;em&gt;guaranteed&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; throw an exception. If you know that you are passing such a set of arguments, you could use this trick to stop the compiler from bothering you about this impossible exception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;overloading&quot;&gt;Overloading&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Method overloading means that a class has several methods with the same name but different number or types of parameters and that Java chooses which one to call based on the arguments you pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a simple example, consider the following class. It has two methods with the same name but different parameter types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;OverloadingTest&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;testMethod&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;object&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;testMethod&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;string&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s write some code to get a feel for how overloading works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;OverloadingTest&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;test&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;OverloadingTest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;testObject&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;testString&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;testString&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;testMethod&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;testObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// object&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;testMethod&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;testString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// string&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, things are pretty straightforward. But wat if we get a little bit more creative?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;testStringAsObject&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;testString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, we are taking a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; but giving it a compile-time type of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt;. What happens if we call our method on this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;testMethod&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;testStringAsObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// object&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although we know that &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;stringAsObject&lt;/code&gt; is actually a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;, we see that method overloading only looks at its compile-time type. This is generally true: Java’s method overloading determines the exact signature of the method to call at compile time, using compile-time type information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;overriding&quot;&gt;Overriding&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Method overriding means that a subclass overrides an instance method of a direct or indirect superclass by providing its own implementation. The following code provides a simple example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;OverridingTestSuper&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;testMethod&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;super&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;OverridingTestSub&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;OverridingTestSuper&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@Override&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;testMethod&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;sub&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note how we used the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@Override&lt;/code&gt; annotation to make it clear that the method &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;testMethod&lt;/code&gt; of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;OverridingTestSub&lt;/code&gt; overrides a supertype method. Java will actually check this and throw an error if you use this annotation on a method that does not really override a supertype method. This helps prevent method name typos and it makes sure you notice if the supertype method you are overriding is removed from the code at some point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;OverridingTestSuper&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;testSuper&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;OverridingTestSuper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;OverridingTestSub&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;testSub&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;OverridingTestSub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;testObject&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;testSuper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;testMethod&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;testObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// super&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;testSub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;testMethod&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;testObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// sub&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We clearly see that the actual implementation that is invoked depends on whether we invoke it on the supertype or the subtype.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, what if we start playing around with compile-time types?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;OverridingTestSuper&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;testSubAsSuper&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;testSub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, we are taking a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;OverridingTestSub&lt;/code&gt; but giving it a compile-time type of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;OverridingTestSuper&lt;/code&gt;. What happens if we call its &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;testMethod&lt;/code&gt; method?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;testSubAsSuper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;testMethod&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;testObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// sub&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, which implementation is invoked depends on the actual runtime type of the object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;combining-overloading-and-overriding&quot;&gt;Combining overloading and overriding&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quick recap of how Java determines which implementation to call for an instance method:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The exact &lt;em&gt;signature&lt;/em&gt; of the method to be invoked is determined at &lt;em&gt;compile time&lt;/em&gt; based on the number and compile-time types of arguments.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For instance methods, the exact &lt;em&gt;implementation&lt;/em&gt; of the method to be invoked is determined at &lt;em&gt;runtime&lt;/em&gt; based on the actual runtime type of the object and the structure of the inheritance hierarchy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s combine the two of them in a more complex example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;CombinedTestSuper&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;testMethod&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;super object&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;CombinedTestSub&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;CombinedTestSuper&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@Override&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;testMethod&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;sub object&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;testMethod&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;sub string&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;CombinedTestSuper&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;testSuper&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;CombinedTestSuper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;CombinedTestSub&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;testSub&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;CombinedTestSub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;CombinedTestSuper&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;testSubAsSuper&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;testSub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;testString&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;testString&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;testStringAsObject&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;testString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what will happen if we pass &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;testString&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;testStringAsObject&lt;/code&gt; as parameters to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;testMethod&lt;/code&gt; on &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;testSuper&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;testSub&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;testSubAsSuper&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;testSuper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;testMethod&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;testString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// super object&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;testSuper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;testMethod&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;testStringAsObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// super object&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;testSub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;testMethod&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;testString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// sub string&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;testSub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;testMethod&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;testStringAsObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// sub object&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;testSubAsSuper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;testMethod&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;testString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// sub object&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;testSubAsSuper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;testMethod&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;testStringAsObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// sub object&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results of the calls on &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;testSuper&lt;/code&gt; should not be surprising: it has only one method. The results for &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;testSub&lt;/code&gt; show method overloading at work: even though we are actually passing the same object instance twice, its compile-time type determines the actual signature of the method that is called.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The method calls on &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;testSubAsSuper&lt;/code&gt; are a bit more interesting. We see that, because &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;testSubAsSuper&lt;/code&gt; is actually a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CombinedTestSub&lt;/code&gt; instance, the method implementations that are invoked are the ones in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CombinedTestSub&lt;/code&gt;. However, even though that class uses method overloading to change its behavior based on the compile-time type passed to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;testMethod&lt;/code&gt;, we see that the same implementation is called twice. How is this possible?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;testSubAsSuper&lt;/code&gt; has a compile-time type of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CombinedTestSuper&lt;/code&gt;. If we call its &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;testMethod&lt;/code&gt; method on &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;testString&lt;/code&gt; (with compile-time type &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;), the Java compiler uses these compile-time types to determine the exact signature of the method to invoke. Because &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CombinedTestSuper&lt;/code&gt; only has a definition of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;testMethod&lt;/code&gt; with a parameter of type &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt;, the compiler determines that the signature of the method to invoke is &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;testMethod(Object)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At runtime, the actual implementation to use is determined based on the runtime type of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;testSubAsSuper&lt;/code&gt;, which is &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CombinedTestSub&lt;/code&gt;. However, Java only considers implementations which match the signature determined at compile time. Because that signature is &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;testMethod(Object)&lt;/code&gt;, Java executes the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;testMethod(Object)&lt;/code&gt; implementation on &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CombinedTestSub&lt;/code&gt;, even though it also has a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;testMethod(String)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;method-hiding&quot;&gt;Method hiding&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The parts above focused on instance methods. What about static methods?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Static methods use the same concept of method overloading to determine the exact signature of the method to call based on the compile-time types of the passed arguments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, what happens if a subclass and superclass both implement a static method with the same signature?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;CombinedTestSuper&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;testStaticMethod&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;super&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;CombinedTestSub&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;CombinedTestSuper&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;testStaticMethod&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;sub&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we call the static method directly on the class, we invoke the implementation of that particular class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;testObject&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
		
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;StaticSuper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;testStaticMethod&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;testObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// super&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;StaticSub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;testStaticMethod&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;testObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// sub&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if we try the same with instances of the classes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;StaticSuper&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;staticSuper&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;StaticSuper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;StaticSub&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;staticSub&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;StaticSub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;StaticSuper&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;staticSubAsSuper&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;staticSub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;staticSuper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;testStaticMethod&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;testObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// super&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;staticSub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;testStaticMethod&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;testObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;	&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// sub&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;staticSubAsSuper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;testStaticMethod&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;testObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;	&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// super&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the method we were calling was an instance method, we would have seen method overriding at work and the result of the last call would have been &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&quot;sub&quot;&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&quot;super&quot;&lt;/code&gt;. However, because the method is static, the actual implementation that is called depends on the compile-time type of the object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, that behavior can be pretty confusing. This is why Java actually warns you when calling static methods on class instances, telling you that you should rather call static methods directly on the class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introducing-the-animal-and-dog-class&quot;&gt;Introducing the Animal and Dog class&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post will assume that we have two extremely simple classes, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/code&gt;, where the latter is a subclass of the former.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;    
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;makeSound&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;I'm an animal!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@Override&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;makeSound&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Woof!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;generics-basics&quot;&gt;Generics basics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Java generics allow to define classes, interfaces and methods that work with different types. This happens by adding one or more type parameters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A simple example of a generic interface is the List interface, which allows to specify the type of objects in the list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;List&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dogList&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ArrayList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dogList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dogList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dogList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;());&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// compiler error&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following is an example of a simple generic method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;getFirstAnimal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;List&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;animals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;animals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above example also shows an example of a &lt;em&gt;type bound&lt;/em&gt;: it allows &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; to be the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/code&gt; class or any of its subclasses. The same mechanism can be used for the type parameters of generic classes. Also note that the type parameter can be used inside the class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;AnimalWrapper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;    
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;wrappedAnimal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;AnimalWrapper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;wrappedAnimal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;wrappedAnimal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;wrappedAnimal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;getWrappedAnimal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;wrappedAnimal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;wildcards&quot;&gt;Wildcards&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose that you need a list of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/code&gt;s for something and you define it as a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;List&amp;lt;Animal&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Can you just pass a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;List&amp;lt;Dog&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; in that case?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;List&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dogList&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ArrayList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;List&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;animalList&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dogList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// compiler error&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason why this fails is that a proper &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;List&amp;lt;Animal&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; allows adding any &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/code&gt;, while a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;List&amp;lt;Dog&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; should only allow adding &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/code&gt;s. This means that the two types are not compatible. However, if we only care about the fact that our List contains some kind of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/code&gt;s, we can use type wildcards to define this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;List&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dogList&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ArrayList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;List&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;extendsAnimalList&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dogList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// works&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we define our List as a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;List&amp;lt;? extends Animal&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, we specify that this is a List of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/code&gt; or one of its subclasses. This means that each element in the list is some kind of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/code&gt;. Note that this does not allow us to add any kind of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/code&gt; to the list, because as for all we know, the List might be a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;List&amp;lt;Dog&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; or a List of some other subclass of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;? extends Animal&lt;/code&gt; is called a &lt;em&gt;subtype wildcard&lt;/em&gt;. Another type of wildcard is the &lt;em&gt;supertype wildcard&lt;/em&gt;, for example &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;? super Dog&lt;/code&gt;. If we define a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;List&amp;lt;? super Dog&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, we know that we have a List of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/code&gt; or one of its supertypes. This means that, whatever the specific type of the List is, the list will always allow us to add a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/code&gt; object to it. However, we cannot make any assumptions regarding the types of objects in the list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;List&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dogList&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ArrayList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;List&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;extendsAnimalList&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dogList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;animal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;extendsAnimalList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// works&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;extendsAnimalList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;());&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// compiler error&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;List&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;super&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;superDogList&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dogList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;animal2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;superDogList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// compiler error&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;superDogList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;());&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// works&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could also use a wildcard without bounds when you are doing something very generic and don’t care at all about the value of the type parameter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;generics-in-the-java-virtual-machine&quot;&gt;Generics in the Java Virtual Machine&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to get a better understanding of how generics behave in Java, it helps to take a look at what’s happening under the hood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;type-erasure&quot;&gt;Type erasure&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Java only added generics in version 1.5. Before that, instead of the generic &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ArrayList&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, there was just the class &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ArrayList&lt;/code&gt;. When introducing generics, the Java team decided to maintain compatibility by actually erasing the generic type information at compile time, meaning that the byte code running in the Java Virtual Machine does not know anything about generics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example, consider let’s go back to our &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;AnimalWrapper&lt;/code&gt; class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;AnimalWrapper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;    
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;wrappedAnimal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;AnimalWrapper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;wrappedAnimal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;wrappedAnimal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;wrappedAnimal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;getWrappedAnimal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;wrappedAnimal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This generic type is compiled into the follow &lt;em&gt;raw&lt;/em&gt; type:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;AnimalWrapper&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;    
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;wrappedAnimal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;AnimalWrapper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;wrappedAnimal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;wrappedAnimal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;wrappedAnimal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;getWrappedAnimal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;wrappedAnimal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the wrappedAnimal has now become an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/code&gt; after type erasure. This makes sense: our type bound restricted the type T to be &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/code&gt; or one of its subclasses. Type parameters without type bounds are erased to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before erasing the types, the compiler checks for errors involving generic types. For example, it will forbid wrapping an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/code&gt; in an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;AnimalWrapper&amp;lt;Dog&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. This means that, although the types are erased later on, we know that the type variables are respected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cast-insertion&quot;&gt;Cast insertion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the compiler checks for generic type mismatches, that this in itself is not always enough. An example is the following code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;List&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dogList&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ArrayList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;();&lt;/span&gt;        
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;List&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rawList&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dogList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;        
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;animal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rawList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;animal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code will generate compiler warnings, but if you ignore those, it can compile and run without issues. This is strange, because we now have an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/code&gt; object sitting in a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;List&amp;lt;Dog&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. This is known as &lt;em&gt;heap pollution&lt;/em&gt;. What about type safety?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, the way this is handled in Java is that the compiler inserts a cast whenever the code &lt;em&gt;reads&lt;/em&gt; from an expression with erased type. This means that, while we can add the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/code&gt; to our &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;List&amp;lt;Dog&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, we will get a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ClassCastException&lt;/code&gt; if we try to retrieve that &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/code&gt; as a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;List&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dogList&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ArrayList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;();&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;List&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rawList&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dogList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;animal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rawList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;animal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;retrievedAnimal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dogList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// works&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;retrievedDog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dogList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// ClassCastException&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The behavior of the above code can be explained by looking at the compiled code, which is equivalent to the code below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;List&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dogList&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ArrayList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;List&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rawList&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dogList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;animal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rawList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;animal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// note that the erased List.get() method returns an Object&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// cast insertion generates casts based on target type&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;retrievedAnimal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dogList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// works&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;retrievedDog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dogList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// ClassCastException&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that we don’t get an exception when we try to retrieve the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/code&gt; as an actual &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/code&gt;. Also note that, when we get the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ClassCastException&lt;/code&gt; on the last line, that does not help us to find the actual source of the problem (which is the code where we inserted an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/code&gt; inside a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;List&amp;lt;Dog&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;). When debugging such problem, it can be useful to use a checked view of the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;List&lt;/code&gt;. This checks the type of inserted objects as they are inserted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;List&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dogList&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Collections&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;checkedList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ArrayList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;(),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;List&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rawList&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dogList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;animal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rawList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;animal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// ClassCastException&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note the use of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Dog.class&lt;/code&gt;, a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Class&amp;lt;Dog&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; instance which is needed to know the actual value of the type parameter for the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;List&lt;/code&gt;. We will revisit the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Class&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; class further down this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bridge-methods&quot;&gt;Bridge methods&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some cases, basic type erasure would lead to problems with method overriding. In order to prevent this, the Java compiler sometimes generates &lt;em&gt;bridge methods&lt;/em&gt;. As an example, consider the class &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GoodBoyList&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;GoodBoyList&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ArrayList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@Override&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;pet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s say we use this class in the following way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;GoodBoyList&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;goodBoyList&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;GoodBoyList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ArrayList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dogList&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;goodBoyList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dogList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After erasure, the last line calls the erased &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;add(Object)&lt;/code&gt; method on the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ArrayList&lt;/code&gt; class. We would expect the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;add(Dog)&lt;/code&gt; method on &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GoodBoyList&lt;/code&gt; to override that method, but the problem is that the method signatures are different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The compiler solves this by inserting a bridge method &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;add(Object)&lt;/code&gt; into the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GoodBoyList&lt;/code&gt; class. That method looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// overrides ArrayList.add(Object)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// calls add(Dog) &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After erasure, it is the bridge method that actually overrides the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ArrayList.add(Object)&lt;/code&gt; method. It then calls the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GoodBoyList.add(Dog)&lt;/code&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bridge methods can also be used when the return type varies. For example, imagine that our &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GoodBoyList&lt;/code&gt; also overrides the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;get(int)&lt;/code&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;GoodBoyList&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ArrayList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@Override&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;pet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After erasure, we need a bridge method to make overriding work here. This way, we get two &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;get&lt;/code&gt; methods in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GoodBoyList&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Dog get(int)&lt;/code&gt;: this is the actual method as defined in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GoodBoyList&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Object get(int)&lt;/code&gt;: this is a generated bridge method that overrides the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Object get(int)&lt;/code&gt; method in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ArrayList&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may seem strange, because the compiler would never allow you to write a class with two methods with the same name taking the same number and type of arguments. However, inside the Java Virtual Machine, a method is defined by its name, the number and types of its arguments &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; by its return type. This is why the bridge method is needed, and also why it is allowed to exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The compiler takes care of the generation of bridge methods, so in principle you don’t have to worry about them. However, they may show up in stack traces or explain why the compiler complains about certain pieces of code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-class-class&quot;&gt;The Class class&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Java language has a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Class&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; class. A &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Class&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; object represent the class &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;T&lt;/code&gt;. This class object can directly be obtained from the class &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;T&lt;/code&gt;. It is also possible to to get a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Class&lt;/code&gt; object from an instance of a class, but in that case you are getting the actual run-time type of that instance, which may be a subclass of its compile-time type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;test&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// ok&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;test2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;getClass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// error&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;test3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;getClass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// ok&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Class&lt;/code&gt; class to get more information regarding the value of a type variable at run-time (so after type erasure). As an example, the below code for the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Test&lt;/code&gt; class forces you to pass a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Class&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; object where &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; is exactly value of the type variable of class &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Test&lt;/code&gt;. Even though the generic type information is erased during compilation, you can still determine the type of objects you are dealing with by looking at the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Class&lt;/code&gt; instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;    
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;objectClass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Main&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;            
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Class&lt;/code&gt; object we receive is the exact class of the type parameter’s value, but it is not necessarily the exact class of the object that we receive. That object may be an instance of a subclass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Class&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; object is also very useful when using reflection. For example, it can help you access the constructor(s) for the class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;generics-restrictions&quot;&gt;Generics restrictions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;type-arguments-cannot-be-primitives&quot;&gt;Type arguments cannot be primitives&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A type parameter must always be &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt; or a subclass of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt;. This means that, for example, it is not possible to define an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ArrayList&amp;lt;int&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;at-runtime-all-types-are-raw&quot;&gt;At runtime, all types are raw&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Type erasure means that, at runtime, all types are raw. Therefore, something like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;if (object instanceof ArrayList&amp;lt;Dog&amp;gt;)&lt;/code&gt; will not compile because this check is impossible to execute at runtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Class&lt;/code&gt; instances that you get are also always raw types. There is no &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ArrayList&amp;lt;Dog&amp;gt;.class&lt;/code&gt;, only &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ArrayList.class&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;type-variables-cannot-be-instantiated&quot;&gt;Type variables cannot be instantiated&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a type variable &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;T&lt;/code&gt;, you cannot do &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;new T(...)&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;new T[...]&lt;/code&gt; (array). This is forbidden because of type erasure (you would be instantiating the erased value for &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;T&lt;/code&gt;, not &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; itself).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to construct objects of type &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; or arrays of type &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; inside a generic method, you will have to ask the caller for the right object or array constructor or for a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Class&lt;/code&gt; object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that, while you cannot instantiate an array of type &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;T&lt;/code&gt;, you can easily create an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ArrayList&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. This is because &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ArrayList&lt;/code&gt; is a generic type itself, while in order to create an array of type &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; we would need the exact type &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; at runtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;its-impossible-to-create-arrays-of-parameterized-types&quot;&gt;It’s impossible to create arrays of parameterized types&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although you can declare arrays of a parameterized type (e.g. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;AnimalWrapper&amp;lt;Dog&amp;gt;[]&lt;/code&gt;), it is not possible to instantiate an array of that type. This is because, after erasure, we would just get an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;AnimalWrapper[]&lt;/code&gt; array that allows any kind of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;AnimalWrapper&lt;/code&gt; without throwing an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ArrayStoreException&lt;/code&gt;. If that is what you want, you can create an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;AnimalWrapper[]&lt;/code&gt; and then cast it to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;AnimalWrapper&amp;lt;Dog&amp;gt;[]&lt;/code&gt; (this will generate compiler warnings though).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The simplest solution is often to just create an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ArrayList&amp;lt;AnimalWrapper&amp;lt;Dog&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;class-type-variables-are-not-valid-in-static-contexts&quot;&gt;Class type variables are not valid in static contexts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Type variables defined at the level of the class cannot be used in static contexts (static variables and static methods). For example, if you have a class with type parameter &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;T&lt;/code&gt;, you cannot have a static variable of type &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;T&lt;/code&gt;. This makes sense: you can use a class multiple times with different values for &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; but a static variable only exists once (on the raw type), so it’s impossible to have a static variable with the exact type &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; for each of those values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that you can still use type variables in static contexts if they are not defined at the level of the class. For example, you can have a static method parameterized with type &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; if that type parameter is declared at the level of the method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;methods-may-not-clash-after-erasure&quot;&gt;Methods may not clash after erasure&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are not allowed to declare methods that would clash after erasure (meaning that, after erasure, there would be two methods with the same signature).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that this includes bridge methods! If you get a compiler error about methods clashing after erasure, it’s possible that the clash is generated by the bridge methods generated by the compiler. This is why it’s important to have some understanding of what these bridge methods are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;exceptions-and-generics&quot;&gt;Exceptions and generics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not possible to throw objects of a generic class. This makes sense, because catching instances of a generic class with a specific type parameter would require information that is not available at runtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it is allowed to have a type variable in your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;throws&lt;/code&gt; declaration, as this is checked by the compiler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;resources&quot;&gt;Resources&lt;/h2&gt;
